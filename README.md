# SmartCampus: Unified AI-Powered Accommodation Booking App for University Students

Welcome to the SmartCampus GitHub repository! This project showcases the user interface (UI) for SmartCampus, a visionary platform designed to streamline the accommodation booking process for university students.

## Introduction

SmartCampus is all about making student life easier. Imagine a world where finding your perfect student accommodation is as easy as a few taps on your phone. That’s what I’m building with SmartCampus – a user-friendly app that aggregates all the best hostels, halls, and homestays in and around your campus. 

## Features
